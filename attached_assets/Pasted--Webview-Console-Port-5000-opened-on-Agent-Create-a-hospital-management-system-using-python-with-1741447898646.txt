Let me explain how the Hospital Management System works:

First-time Setup:
When you first access the system, it will prompt you to create an admin account since none exists
You'll need to set up a username and password for the admin
Regular Usage:
After the admin account is created, you can log in using those credentials
Only one admin can exist at a time for security
Once logged in, you'll see a navigation menu with these sections:
Dashboard: Overview of hospital statistics
Patients: Manage patient records
Appointments: Schedule and track appointments
Inventory: Track medical supplies
Staff: Manage hospital staff
Billing: Handle patient billing
Reports: View analytics and generate reports
Audit Log: Track all system activities
Would you like me to show you how to set up the admin account and start using the system?
